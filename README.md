# NLP Text Classifier (Sentiment Analysis)

A beginner-friendly NLP project where I train a sentiment classifier on a small dataset.  
Built to practice text preprocessing, vectorization, and basic machine learning models.

---

## Features
- Cleans and preprocesses text  
- Converts text → numerical features (TF-IDF)  
- Trains a Logistic Regression sentiment classifier  
- Evaluates accuracy + confusion matrix  
- Contains modular Python scripts
